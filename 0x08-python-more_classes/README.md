# Python - more classes

## Resources

## Read or watch

- [Object Oriented Programming](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/M-MFweENpRdEfRto_Gzlvg)(Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” (excluded))
- [Object-Oriented Programming](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/_Awd8Gn4SBdq2FRd_bY8KA)(Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows the way you should not use or write a class, in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read only the following paragraphs: “General Introduction,” “First-class Everything,” “A Minimal Class in Python,” “Attributes,” “Methods,” “The **init** Method,” “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “**str**- and **repr**-Methods,” “Public- Protected- and Private Attributes,” & “Destructor”)
- [Class and Instance Attributes](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/_Awd8Gn4SBdq2FRd_bY8KA)
- [classmethods and staticmethods](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/Ij1EnTg02gtIknOkNv4xGA)
- [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/xjpk-jUNe0uGEzcNXbwIHQ) (Mainly the last part “Public instead of Private Attributes”)
- [str vs repr](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/iu1ILT-t6FMuZvk7vRvfuQ)
