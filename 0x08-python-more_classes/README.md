# More classes and Objects

Python is an Object Oriented Programming Language (OOP). Classes and Objects are the two main aspect of OOP. A class creates a new type while objects are instances of the class.

## Classes

The simplest definition of class in python is shown in the example below `(save as simple_class.py):`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/python3
class Rectangle:
"""An empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle"""
    pass  # An empty block

Object1 = Rectangle()
print(Object1)
```

## Output

```bash
$ ./simple_class.py
<class '__main__.Rectangle'>
```

### PS

This is a project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX_AFRICA. The objectives of the project is teach ALX-SE students about object oriented programming (OOP), Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, instances and classes attributes in Python.
