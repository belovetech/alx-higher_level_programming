# Test Driven Development

## **Concepts**

![Never forget a test](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-higher-level_programming+/246/giphy-4.gif)

Testing is the process of evaluating a system or its components(s) with the intent to find out if it satisfies the specified requirements or not. The main purpose of testing is to identify any gaps, errors, or missing requirements contrary to the actual requirements.

Remember code that is not tested cannot be trusted

### PS

This is a project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX_AFRICA. The objectives of the project is to introduce the concept of docstrings and how to create and implement tests in Python.
